    "I think this is a very intersting article on using common sense while writing the better manageable , maintainable code. It highlights the fine line on when to reuse vs when to write your own , when to modularize vs when to write big monoliths etc. People spend more time and effort on reengineering code than writing new most of the times , if the code is concise and clear , it makes the job easier for investigation when things go wrong. The best advice or takeaway is \"Becoming a professional software developer is accumulating a back-catalogue of regrets and mistakes. You learn nothing from success. It is not that you know what good code looks like, but the scars of bad code are fresh in your mind.\"\n"

In row 0, there is one position a marble can be in (labeled 0), in row 1, there are two positions (labeled 0 and 1), and so forth.  Each time the marble bounces from one row to the next, there is a 50% probability it bounces left and a 50% probability it bounces right.\n",

Specifically, it is a Binomial distribution with parameters N and 0.5.  As you let N grow larger and larger, the Binomial distribution will approach the famous Normal distribution that you will see over and over in parametric statistics.  This is a consequence of an extremely important result known as the Central Limit Theorem."

    "## Part 5 - Sorting Marbles\n",
    "\n",
    "In a particular board game, there are N spaces in a row, numbered 0 through N - 1 from left to right. There are also N marbles, numbered 0 through N - 1, initially placed in some arbitrary order. After that, there are two moves available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Switch: Switch the marbles in positions 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Rotate: Move the marble in position 0 to position N - 1, and move all other marbles one space to the left (one index lower).\n",
    "The objective is to arrange the marbles in order, with each marble i in position i.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Write a class, MarblesBoard, to represent the game above. The class should be initialized with a particular sequence of Marbles.  Write an \\_\\_init\\_\\_ function that takes a starting sequence of marbles (the number of each marble listed in the positions from 0 to N - 1).\n",
    "Next, write switch() and rotate() methods to simulate the player's moves. Write a method, is_solved(), that returns True if the marbles are in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you may want to write \\_\\_str\\_\\_ and \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ methods that display the current state of the board. Your class should behave like the following example.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board = MarblesBoard((3,6,7,4,1,0,8,2,5)) \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 6 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "6 3 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.rotate() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 6 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "7 3 4 1 0 8 2 5 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Write a second class, Solver, that actually plays the MarblesGame. You class should take a MarblesBoard in its initializer. Write a solve() method that repeatedly calls the switch() and rotate() methods of the given MarblesBoard until the game is solved.  You should print the state of the board after each move.  Additionally, print out the total number of moves at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to come up with your own algorithm for solving the marbles game.  Before you write your solve() method, you may want to practice solving some small versions of the marbles game yourself.  Here is an example of using a Solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board2 = MarblesBoard((1,3,0,2))\n",
    ">>> solver = Solver(board2)\n",
    ">>> solver.solve()\n",
    "1 3 0 2 \n",
    "3 0 2 1 \n",
    "0 2 1 3 \n",
    "2 1 3 0 \n",
    "1 2 3 0 \n",
    "2 3 0 1 \n",
    "3 0 1 2 \n",
    "0 1 2 3 \n",
    "total steps: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Solver does not that to follow the fastest possible running time, but you should strive to make it reasonably efficient.  When you are done, compute the (tightest) big-O running time bound for your script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may be interested to know that your program is a variation of a well-known sorting algorithm called bubble sort.  Bubble sort would normally be used on a list of items, not on a rotating track, but adapting your algorithm to this setting would be easy."
